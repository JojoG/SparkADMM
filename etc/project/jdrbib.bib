abstract = {The U.S. Geological Survey is tapping a vast new source of engineering seismology data through its "Did You Feel It?" (DYFI) program, which collects online citizen responses to earthquakes. To date, more than 750,000 responses have been compiled in the United States alone. The DYFI data make up in quantity what they may lack in scientific quality and offer the potential to resolve longstanding issues in earthquake ground-motion science. Such issues have been difficult to address due to the paucity of instrumental ground-motion data in regions of low seismicity. In particular, DYFI data provide strong evidence that earthquake stress drops, which control the strength of high-frequency ground shaking, are higher in the central and eastern United States (CEUS) than in California. Higher earthquake stress drops, coupled with lower attenuation of shaking with distance, result in stronger overall shaking over a wider area and thus more potential damage for CEUS earthquakes in comparison to those of equal magnitude in California-a fact also definitively captured with these new DYFI data and maps.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added l1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive l1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright \& Jordan (2006)), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

abstract = {This article investigates the problem of incorporating mobile probe data collected from GPS equipped cell phones into estimation algorithms for travel time. We use kinematic wave theory to create a modeling framework capable of incorporating trajectory data into the model. The problem of including loop detector data in this model is performed using a standard approach available in the literature. The problem of fusing this data with probe data is formulated using the Moskowitz function, which results from kinematic wave theory. Using this formulation, two linear programs are posed to compute upper and lower bounds travel time through the corresponding section of highway. The method thus provides a guaranteed range for the average travel time experienced by vehicles on the highway. The method is illustrated with data collected during the Mobile Century experiment on February 8th, 2008, using 100 Nokia N95 phones traveling onboard cars driving loops on I880 in California. A sampling and penetration rate study shows that the method provides accurate travel time estimates for penetration rates as low as 0.1\% and spatial sampling strategies on the order of 0.2 miles. The performance of the method is illustrated with several case studies, in which measurements gathered by a few vehicles are sufficient to significantly improve results obtained from sparse loop detectors.},

abstract = {We study economic incentives for influencing selfish behavior in networks. We consider a model of selfish routing in which the latency experienced by network traffic on an edge of the network is a function of the edge congestion, and network users are assumed to selfishly route traffic on minimum-latency paths. The quality of a routing of traffic is historically measured by the sum of all travel times, also called the total latency.. It is well known that the outcome of selfish routing (a flow at Nash equilibrium) does not minimize the total latency, and that marginal cost pricing-charging each network user for the congestion effects caused by its presence-eliminates the inefficiency of selfish routing. However, the principle of marginal cost pricing assumes that taxes cause no disutility to network users; this is appropriate only when collected taxes can be feasibly returned (directly or indirectly) to the users, If this assumption does not hold and we wish to minimize the total user disutility (latency plus taxes paid)-the total cost-how should we price the network edges? Intuition may suggest that taxes can never improve the cost of a Nash equilibrium, but the famous Braess's Paradox shows this intuition to be incorrect. We consider strategies for pricing network edges to reduce the cost of a Nash equilibrium. Since levying a sufficiently large tax on an edge effectively removes it from the network, our study generalizes previous work on designing networks for selfish users T Roughgarden, Designing networks for selfish users is hard, in: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2001, pp. 472-481 (full version to appear in Journal of Computer and System Sciences). In this paper, we prove the following results. In a large class of networks-including all networks with linear latency functions-marginal cost taxes do not improve the cost of a Nash equilibrium. The largest-possible benefit from taxes does not exceed that from edge removals. In ever), network with linear latency functions, the benefit of taxes cannot exceed that of removing edges. There are networks with nonlinear latency functions, however, in which taxes are radically more powerful than edge removals. For every epsilon > 0, there is no (4/3 - epsilon)-approximation algorithm for computing optimal taxes, even in networks with linear latency functions (assuming P not equal NP).

The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ(1) (the lasso), ℓ(2) (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

@article{Herrera2010,
abstract = {Cell-phones equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) provide new opportunities for location-based services and traffic estimation. When traveling on-board vehicles, these phones can be used to accurately provide position and velocity of the vehicle as probe traf- fic sensors. This article presents a new technique to incorporate mobile probe measure- ments into highway traffic flow models, and compares it to a Kalman filtering approach. These two techniques are both used to reconstruct traffic density. The first technique mod- ifies the LighthillWhithamRichards partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate a correction term which reduces the discrepancy between the measurements (from the probe vehicles) and the estimated state (from the model). This technique, called Newtonian relaxation, nudges the model to the measurements. The second technique is based on Kalman filtering and the framework of hybrid systems, which implements an observer equation into a linearized flow model. Both techniques assume the knowledge of the fun- damental diagram and the conditions at both boundaries of the section of interest. The techniques are designed in a way in which does not require the knowledge of on- and off-ramp detector counts, which in practice are rarely available. The differences between both techniques are assessed in the context of the Next Generation Simulation program (NGSIM), which is used as a benchmark data set to compare both methods. They are finally tested with data from the Mobile Century experiment obtained from 100 Nokia N95 mobile phones on I-880 in California on February 8, 2008. The results are promising, showing that the proposed methods successfully incorporate the GPS data in the estimation of traffic.},

abstract = {User equilibrium is a central concept for studying transportation networks, and one can view it as the result of a dynamical process of drivers' route choice behavior. In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks.},

abstract = {Active traffic management (ATM) is the ability to dynamically manage recurrent and non-recurrent congestion based on prevailing traffic conditions in order to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of road networks. It is a continuous process of (i) obtaining and analysing traffic measurement data, (ii) operations planning, i.e. simulating various scenarios and control strategies, (iii) implementing the most promising control strategies in the field, and (iv) maintaining a real-time decision support system that filters current traffic measurements to predict the traffic state in the near future, and to suggest the best available control strategy for the predicted situation. ATM relies on a fast and trusted traffic simulator for the rapid quantitative assessment of a large number of control strategies for the road network under various scenarios, in a matter of minutes. The open-source macrosimulation tool Aurora ROAD NETWORK MODELER is a good candidate for this purpose. The paper describes the underlying dynamical traffic model and what it takes to prepare the model for simulation; covers the traffic performance measures and evaluation of scenarios as part of operations planning; introduces the framework within which the control strategies are modelled and evaluated; and presents the algorithm for real-time traffic state estimation and short-term prediction.},

@article{Maille2009,
abstract = {This article considers a mechanism based on rebates that aims at reducing congestion in urban networks. The framework helps select rebate levels so that enough commuters switch to modes that are under used. Indeed, getting a relative small number of drivers to switch to public transportation can significantly improve congestion. This mechanism is modeled by a Stackelberg game in which the transportation authority offers rebates, and participants factor them into the costs of each mode. A new Wardrop equilibrium arises when participants selfishly select one of the modes of transportation with the lowest updated costs. Rebate levels are chosen taking into account not only the potential reduction of the participants' cost, but also the cost of providing those rebates. Part of the budget for rebates may come from the savings that arise from the more efficient use of capacity. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibria of the game, and describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the optimal rebates for each mode. In addition, we provide tight results on the worst-case inefficiency of the resulting Wardrop equilibrium, measured by the so-called price of anarchy. Specifically, we describe the tradeoff between the sensitivity of the owner towards rebate costs and the worst-case inefficiency of the system.},

@misc{Mateos2010,
abstract = {The Lasso is a popular technique for joint estimation and continuous variable selection, especially well-suited for sparse and possibly under-determined linear regression problems. This paper develops algorithms to estimate the regression coefficients via Lasso when the training data are distributed across different agents, and their communication to a central processing unit is prohibited for e.g., communication cost or privacy reasons. A motivating application is explored in the context of wireless communications, whereby sensing cognitive radios collaborate to estimate the radio-frequency power spectrum density. Attaining different tradeoffs between complexity and convergence speed, three novel algorithms are obtained after reformulating the Lasso into a separable form, which is iteratively minimized using the alternating-direction method of multipliers so as to gain the desired degree of parallelization. Interestingly, the per agent estimate updates are given by simple soft-thresholding operations, and inter-agent communication overhead remains at affordable level. Without exchanging elements from the different training sets, the local estimates consent to the global Lasso solution, i.e., the fit that would be obtained if the entire data set were centrally available. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed distributed schemes, corroborating their convergence and global optimality. The ideas in this paper can be easily extended for the purpose of fitting related models in a distributed fashion, including the adaptive Lasso, elastic net, fused Lasso and nonnegative garrote.},

Our algorithm solves BP on a distributed platform such as a sensor network, and is designed to minimize the communication between nodes. The algorithm only requires the network to be connected, has no notion of a central processing node, and no node has access to the entire matrix A at any time. We consider two scenarios in which either the columns or the rows of A are distributed among the compute nodes. Our algorithm, named D-ADMM, is a decentralized implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show through numerical simulation that our algorithm requires considerably less communications between the nodes than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Our algorithm is based on a variant of the existence proof due to Hart and Schmeidler, and employs linear programming duality, the ellipsoid algorithm, Markov chain steady state computations, as well as application-specific methods for computing multivariate expectations over product distributions. For anonymous games and graphical games of bounded tree-width, we provide a different polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing an arbitrary linear function over the set of correlated equilibria of the game. In contrast to our sweeping positive results for computing an arbitrary correlated equilibrium, we prove that optimizing over correlated equilibria is NP-hard in all of the other classes of games that we consider.},

abstract = {Thanks to the important and increasing growth of the carpooling phenomenon throughout the world, many researchers have particularly focused their efforts on this concept. Most of the existent systems present multiple drawbacks regarding automation, functionalities, accessibility, etc. Besides, only few researchers focused on real time carpooling concept without producing promising results. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel approach called DOMARTiC: a Distributed Optimized approach based on the Multi-Agent concept for the implementation of a Real Time Carpooling service. We particularly focus on the distributed and dynamic aspect not only within the geographical networks representation but also regarding the used automatic tools and the implementing algorithms. Adequate modeling on the base of which a distributed architecture is set up has been adopted helping to perform decentralized parallel process. This helped to take into consideration different aspects we should be involved in, especially the optimization issue as users' requests must be performed in a reasonable runtime. Responses provided to users should also be efficient with regards to the fixed optimization criteria},

@article{TravisWaller2006,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the system optimum-dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem when the time-dependent demands are random variables with known probability distributions. The model is a stochastic extension of a deterministic linear programming formulation for SO-DTA introduced by Ziliaskopoulos (Ziliaskopoulos, A.K., 2000. A linear programming model for the single destination system optimum dynamic traffic assignment problem, Transportation Science, 34, 1-12). The proposed formulation is chance-constrained based and we demonstrate that it provides a robust SO solution with a user specified level of reliability. The model provides numerous insights and can be a useful tool in producing robust control and management strategies that account for uncertainty in applications where SO-DTA is relevant (e.g. evacuation modeling, computing alternate routes around freeway incidents and establishing lower bounds on network performance).

Estimation of shaking over the entire regional extent of southern California is obtained by the spatial interpolation of the measured ground motions with geologically based frequency and amplitude-dependent site corrections. Production of the maps is automatic, triggered by any significant earthquake in southern California. Maps are now made available within several minutes of the earthquake for public and scientific consumption via the World Wide Web; they will be made available with dedicated communications for emergency response agencies and critical users.},
